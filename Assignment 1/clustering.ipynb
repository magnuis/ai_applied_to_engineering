    "### Clustering\n",
    "The KMeans clustering with three clusters appears to more or less have taken one of the clusters obtained with `n_components=2`, and split it. This caused difficulties in separating the two new clusters, and did not provide useful insights. We therefore focused on two clusters for obtaining customer profiles. \n",
