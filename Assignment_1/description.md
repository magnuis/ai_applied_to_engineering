1. Download the customer_data_large dataset from the Example datasets section in Atenea. A description of the columns is also available.

2. Check if the data requires some preprocessing. At the very least, you should have the data scaled for k-means and PCA. Take into account that you can always unscale the data for better interpretation of the results.

3. Apply k-means clustering, PCA and t-SNE to the data.

4. Work on the following topics:
   - Compare different metrics to decide on the number of clusters.
   - Characterize the clusters: which variables are more relevant to separate the clusters and which variables are more common between the members of each cluster. You can use numbers and/or visualizations. From these results, obtain some customer profiles.
   - Use PCA and t-SNE and check if visualization suggest groups in the data. Compare with the groups obtained with k-means.

At the end of k-means example notebook there are some suggestions that can help you in working on the previous topics.
